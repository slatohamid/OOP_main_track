# OOP Bootcamp

**Type of Challenge:** Learning  
**Duration:** 1-2 day(s)  
**Deployment strategy:** n/a  
**Team challenge:** solo

## Learning Objectives

Congratulations! You have a solid understanding of the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Now, it's time to put your knowledge into practice and experiment with different use cases. Applying OOP principles is a hands-on experience that will enhance your familiarity with this paradigm.

**Note:** You can use any programming language of your choice for this exercise, but it's important to be consistent.

## The Mission

This exercise comprises multiple use cases. It is recommended to use a single repository and create multiple folders within it to organize your solutions.

ðŸ’¡ There isn't a single perfect solution; there are numerous approaches with their own pros and cons. Discussing these variations can be an excellent learning opportunity.

### Use Case #1

A basket contains the following items:

- Bananas (6 pieces, costing â‚¬1 each)
- Apples (3 pieces, costing â‚¬1.5 each)
- Bottles of wine (2 bottles, costing â‚¬10 each)

Without using classes, perform the following in your code:

1. Calculate the total price.
2. Calculate the tax amount (6% for fruits, 21% for wine).

Next, repeat the same tasks using classes. Observe and compare the style preferences, time needed to code, structural differences, and readability. From now on, unless stated otherwise, it's recommended to use classes.

### Use Case #2

Consider the same basket as in Use Case #1. The shop owner wants to offer a 50% discount on every fruit. Implement the discount once and efficiently reuse it for every fruit.

### Use Case #3

We are preparing three types of content for a website:

- Articles
- Ads
- Vacancies

All of them have a title and text. When displaying the title, apply the following modifications:

- Articles remain as they are.
- Ads are shown in all caps.
- Vacancies are appended with " - apply now!". The original title should still be retrievable, ensuring no modification is permanent.

Create an array with two articles, one ad, and one vacancy. Use this array to display all content types (title + text).

**Bonus:** An article can be marked as "breaking news". If this is the case, prepend the title with "BREAKING: ". **Extra bonus:** Display all the content with the appropriate HTML tags.

### Use Case #4

There are two groups, each with 10 students. Every student has a name (yes, even Jaqen) and receives a grade. Get creative with the content!

1. Provide an easy way to calculate the average score of a group.
2. Add a function to move a student from one group to another.
3. Show the average score of both groups.
4. Move the top student from one group to the other, replacing the lowest-scoring student.
5. Display the averages again and observe how they were affected.

Happy coding!
